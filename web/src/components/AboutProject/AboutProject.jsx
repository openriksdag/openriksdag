                    The aim of Open Riksdag is to visualize the decision-making process of
                    the swedish parliamentary system. This in an attempt to increase
                    transparency and further strengthen the confidence of the general
                    public in democratic processes. Open Riksdags vision is to make
                    politics accessible for everyone and through visualizing complex data,
                    provide value for the novice and the political deep-diver alike.
